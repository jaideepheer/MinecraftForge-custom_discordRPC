# Custom discordRPC
This MinecraftForge mod allows you to use custom Rich Presense Text for the Discord client.

A JSON config file named `discordRPconfig.json` is automatically generated by the mod in the `config` folder and this file stores all the mod's configs.

* The config file contains the `Discord APP ID` key whose value tells the mod what __APP ID__ must be sent to the Discord client.
This allows you to use a custom Discord App so that you can use custom images or a custom APP Name.

* Then there is the `Rich Presence Profiles` key which defines all the profiles that the mod should use.
> A profile is simply a key specifying the profile name with the value as a JSON block that defines certain properties which tell the mod exactly what to show in the Discord Rich Presence whenever the profile is activated.

* Each profile has a `name` followed by a JSON block containing its properties.

  }

```
> The above config file has only one profile named `default` and its `Activation Event` property is set to `JUST_STARTED`.

</p></details>

Each profile has a `Activation Event` property whose value tells the mod when to activate that profile. 
If this property is not present in a profile then that profile will never be activated. 
<details>
  <summary>The <code>Activation Event</code> property can currently have the following values</summary>
  <p>
  
| Activation Event | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| JUST_STARTED     | This event occours when the mod is loaded into memory. Currently specifying this activation event has no use since it occours before the config file is read. |
| PRE_INIT         | This event occours when Forge calls the `pre-init` function, i.e during the `pre-init` phase of loading. |
| INIT | This event occours when Forge calls the `init` function, i.e during the `init` phase of loading. |
| POST_INIT | This event occours when Forge calls the `post-init` function, i.e during the `post-init` phase of loading. |
| MAIN_MENU_REACHED | This event occours when the main menu screen is displayed. |
| SERVER_ABOUT_TO_START | This event occours __before__ a __Single-Player__ world starts. |
| SERVER_STARTING | This event occours __while__ a __Single-Player__ world is starting. |
| SERVER_STARTED | This event occours __after__ a __Single-Player__ world has started. |
| SERVER_STOPPING | This event occours __while__ a __Single-Player__ world is stopping. |
| SERVER_STOPPED | This event occours __after__ a __Single-Player__ world has stopped. |

  Each profile also has a few properties that specify exactly what must be displayed in the Discord Rich Presence.
  If a property is not specified for a profile, then that property is disabled for that profile thus allowing you to have small config files by ommiting useless properties.
  <details>
  <summary>Each profile currently has the following properties</summary>
  <p>
  
| Property                 | Datatype | Description |
|--------------------------|----------|-------------|
| Activation Event | String | This stores the activation event of this profile, eg: `MAIN_MENU_REACHED`. |
| Game State | String | This is discord's state string. |
| Details | String | This is discord's details string. |
| Party ID | String | This is discord's party ID string. |
| Party Current Size | Integer | This is discord's party size string. |
| Party Max Size | Integer | This is discord's party size max string. |
| Start Timestamp | Long | This is discord's start timestamp string. |
| End Timestamp | Long | This is discord's end timestamp string. |
| Start Time Delay | Long | When this is set, `Start Timestamp` is ignored and discord is given a startTimestamp that is `profileActivationTime + value` where `value` is this field's value. |
| End Time Delay | Long | Similar to `Start Time Delay`. |
| Big Image Key | String | This is discord's large image key string. |
| Big Image Hover Text | String | This is discord's large image text string. |
| Small Image Key | String | This is discord's small image key string. |
| Small Image Hover Text | String | This is discord's small image text string. |
| Join Secret | String | This is currently unused. |
| Spectate Secret | String | This is currently unused. |

  # Note
  * You __can__ use your own images by providing a different `Discord APP ID` and your own image key strings in the profiles.
  * You can create your own profiles with different names, however, each profile should have a unique `name` and a unique `Activation Event`.
  * You do __not__ have to create a profile for every `Activation Event`.
  * You do __not__ have to specify all the properties for a profile.
