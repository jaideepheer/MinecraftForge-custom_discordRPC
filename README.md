# Custom discordRPC
This MinecraftForge mod allows you to use custom Rich Presense Text for the Discord client.

A JSON config file named `discordRPconfig.json` is automatically generated by the mod in the `config` folder and this file stores all the mod's configs.

* The config file contains the `Discord APP ID` key whose value tells the mod what __APP ID__ must be sent to the Discord client.
This allows you to use a custom Discord App so that you can use custom images or a custom APP Name.

* Then there is the `Rich Presence Profiles` key which defines all the profiles that the mod should use.
> A profile is simply a key specifying the profile name with the value as a JSON block that defines certain properties which tell the mod exactly what to show in the Discord Rich Presence whenever the profile is activated.

* Each profile has a `name` followed by a JSON block containing its properties.

```json
{
  "Discord APP ID": "462280508068331522",
  "Rich Presence Profiles": {
    "default": {

    }
  }
}
```
> The above config file has only one profile named `default` and its `Activation Event` property is set to `JUST_STARTED`.

</p></details>
<br>

Each profile has a `Activation Event` property whose value tells the mod when to activate that profile. 
If this property is not present in a profile then that profile will never be activated. 
<details>
  <summary>The <code>Activation Event</code> property can currently have the following values</summary>
  <p>
  
| Activation Event | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| JUST_STARTED     | This event occours when the mod is loaded into memory. Currently specifying this activation event has no use since it occours before the config file is read. |
| PRE_INIT         | This event occours when Forge calls the `pre-init` function, i.e during the `pre-init` phase of loading. |
| INIT | This event occours when Forge calls the `init` function, i.e during the `init` phase of loading. |
| POST_INIT | This event occours when Forge calls the `post-init` function, i.e during the `post-init` phase of loading. |
| MAIN_MENU_REACHED | This event occours when the main menu screen is displayed. |
| SERVER_ABOUT_TO_START | This event occours __before__ a __Single-Player__ world starts. |
| SERVER_STARTING | This event occours __while__ a __Single-Player__ world is starting. |
| SERVER_STARTED | This event occours __after__ a __Single-Player__ world has started. |
| SERVER_STOPPING | This event occours __while__ a __Single-Player__ world is stopping. |
| SERVER_STOPPED | This event occours __after__ a __Single-Player__ world has stopped. |

  Each profile also has a few properties that specify exactly what must be displayed in the Discord Rich Presence.
  If a property is not specified for a profile, then that property is disabled for that profile thus allowing you to have small config files by ommiting useless properties.
  <details>
  <summary>Each profile currently has the following properties</summary>
  <p>
  
| Property                 | Datatype | Description |
|--------------------------|----------|-------------|
| Activation Event | String | This stores the activation event of this profile, eg: `MAIN_MENU_REACHED`. |
| Game State | String | This is discord's state string. |
| Details | String | This is discord's details string. |
| Party ID | String | This is discord's party ID string. |
| Party Current Size | Integer | This is discord's party size string. |
| Party Max Size | Integer | This is discord's party size max string. |
| Start Timestamp | Long | This is discord's start timestamp string. |
| End Timestamp | Long | This is discord's end timestamp string. |
| Start Time Delay | Long | When this is set, `Start Timestamp` is ignored and discord is given a startTimestamp that is `profileActivationTime + value` where `value` is this field's value. |
| End Time Delay | Long | Similar to `Start Time Delay`. |
| Big Image Key | String | This is discord's large image key string. |
| Big Image Hover Text | String | This is discord's large image text string. |
| Small Image Key | String | This is discord's small image key string. |
| Small Image Hover Text | String | This is discord's small image text string. |
| Modification JavaScript | String | This is the javascript code that is executed before sending an update to Discord. It uses the Nashorn engine therefore you can use the 'load()' function to load custom js files which will allow you to change the js code without restarting the game. See below to know more. |
| Join Secret | String | This is currently unused. |
| Spectate Secret | String | This is currently unused. |

  # Note
  * You __can__ use your own images by providing a different `Discord APP ID` and your own image key strings in the profiles.
  * You can create your own profiles with different names, however, each profile should have a unique `name` and a unique `Activation Event`.
  * You do __not__ have to create a profile for every `Activation Event`.
  * You do __not__ have to specify all the properties for a profile.
  
  # Modification Javascript
  Each profile has a `Modification JavaScript` property that can be set using the config file.
  
  This property's value __must__ be a String containing valid javascript code.
  
  The provided script is executed using the __Nashorn__ engine and is __pre-loaded__ with the following variables that can be used for processing.
  
  <details>
  <summary>Pre-Loaded variables</summary>
  <p>

| Variable Name | Data Type | Description |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| RichPresence | `net.arikia.dev.drpc.DiscordRichPresence` | This is the `DiscordRichPresence` object that will be passed in the current update to discord and it stores all the information regarding the rich presence. You must change this objects properties to change what is displayed in the rich presence. See [net.arikia.dev.drpc.DiscordRichPresence](https://github.com/Vatuu/discord-rpc/blob/master/src/main/java/net/arikia/dev/drpc/DiscordRichPresence.java)|
| CurrentProfileName | `String` | This is the name of the currently active profile. (Hint: You can use this to make a single js file that behaves differently for different profiles and is executed using the `load()` function) |
| hasProfileChanged | `boolean` | This is a boolean value that is only true when a profile has been changed. __Note__ that after a single execution this value is false even if the RPC update was cancelled using the [ScriptHelper::cancellUpdate()](https://github.com/jaideepheer/MinecraftForge-custom_discordRPC/blob/5f9d87adc33e628df24a4a808ca45aa157231018/src/main/java/jdmcmods/custom_discordrpc/ScriptEngine/modScriptEngine.java#L170). |
| log | org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger::info | This is the logger function used to print output to the log. Just send it an object ant it'll print it to the log. For eg: log('hello') |
| Helper | [`ScriptHelper`](https://github.com/jaideepheer/MinecraftForge-custom_discordRPC/blob/5f9d87adc33e628df24a4a808ca45aa157231018/src/main/java/jdmcmods/custom_discordrpc/ScriptEngine/modScriptEngine.java#L157) | This is perhaps the most usefull variable. It is a custom wrapper object that provides various functions to get data from Minecraft during script execution. For eg. one of its functions is `Helper.getUserName()` which returns a `String`. <br>Eg: `log(Helper.getMCVERSION())` prints the Minecraft version to the log.<br><br> See the [`ScriptHelper`](https://github.com/jaideepheer/MinecraftForge-custom_discordRPC/blob/5f9d87adc33e628df24a4a808ca45aa157231018/src/main/java/jdmcmods/custom_discordrpc/ScriptEngine/modScriptEngine.java#L157) class's doccumentation to know more. |
